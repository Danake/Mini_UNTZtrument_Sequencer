# Mini_UNTZtrument_Sequencer
Mini UNTZtrument step seqencer with working pots for Arduino Leonardo

Everything is set to channel 1, port 0 and the pots are assigned to control 13, 12, 11, 10 if you were looking at it face on (Left to right)

The code was mashed together from multiple sources and is not my own, I just put it together. 

It can probably be improved a lot and may even have leftover code in it. 


Will need to install the libraries
